    <p>Welcome to the hardest way to do a bracket pool.</p>
    <h3>3/25/25 Update!</h3>
    <p>Wow what an opening weekend! And what a crew of the #hardest people I know! Some highlights: 
        - Dillon is leading the field with a stellar round 1 and round 2. Back to back hard copy champ?!
        - Claire forgot to fill in 1 rd 1 game, 2 round 2 games, and 1 round 3 game. However, she amazingly finds herself in the mix of it and only 1 point behind her dearly beloved.
        - Mark spilled ketchup on his bracket
        - Glad to see no one accidentally mailed me any national secrets along with their bracket.
        - Check out the brackets page for insight into everyone's entry fee. "Worth playin for?" -Jeff Probst voice
        Stay hard everyone. -- Commish
