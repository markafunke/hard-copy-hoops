    <h2>3/25/25 Update!</h2>
    <p>Wow what an opening weekend! And what a crew of the #hardest people I know! Some highlights:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Dillon is leading the field with a stellar round 1 and round 2. Back-to-back hard copy champ?!</li>
        <li>Claire forgot to fill in 1 rd 1 game, 2 round 2 games, and 1 round 3 game. However, she amazingly finds herself in the mix and only 1 point behind her dearly beloved.</li>
        <li>Mark spilled ketchup on his bracket.</li>
        <li>Glad to see no one accidentally mailed me any national secrets along with their bracket.</li>
        <li>Check out the Brackets page for insight into everyone’s entry fee. “Worth playin for?” —Jeff Probst voice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3/31/25 Update!</h2>
    <p>And then there were 3...</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We are down to 3 possible winners</li>
        <li>Claire, Bert, and Doback have been eliminated as they have the same remaining picks as a bracket with a higher score.</li>
        <li>Clayton has been eliminated as he had good old rock top winning it all</li>
        <li>Scenarios</li>
        <li>Duke champs: Mark wins</li>
        <li>Auburn champs: DMB wins</li>
        <li>Florida champs: Dillon wins</li>
        <li>Houston champs: Dillon wins by ONE point over DMB is Houston > Auburn, or pretty comfortably if Houston > FL</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Stay hard everyone.<br>-- Commish</p>
